-   What is a CDN?
    - Globally distributed network of servers (edge servers / PoPs).  
    - Stores cached copies of static content close to users.  
    - Reduces latency by serving from nearest edge.  
    - Offloads traffic from origin server.  
    - Provides security, speed, scalability, reliability.

-    CDN Terminology
    | Term          | Meaning                                |
    |---------------|----------------------------------------|
    | Origin Server | Main backend server                    |
    | Edge Server   | CDN node closest to user               |
    | POP           | Point of Presence (CDN location)       |
    | TTL           | Cache lifetime                         |
    | Cache Hit     | Served from CDN                        |
    | Cache Miss    | Fetched from origin                    |
    | Reverse Proxy | CDN forwarding to origin               |

-   Why CDNs Exist (Problems They Solve)
    - 🌍 Slow global performance → latency reduced by serving nearby.  
    - 💻 Origin overload → CDN caches heavy assets.  
    - 💰 High scaling cost → CDN absorbs bandwidth.  
    - 📈 Traffic spikes → CDN prevents origin crashes.  
    - 🔒 Reliability & uptime → site stays functional even if origin slows.

-   How a CDN Works
    Request flow for static content:
    1. User enters URL.  
    2. DNS routes traffic to CDN.  
    3. CDN checks cache.  
        - Cache hit → serve immediately.  
        - Cache miss → fetch from origin → store → serve.  

-   Static vs Dynamic Content
    - 🟦 Static (cacheable): images, CSS, JS, videos, fonts, files.  
        - Cached at edges → lowest latency.  
    - 🟥 Dynamic (not cacheable): user profiles, carts, payments, dashboards, API POST/PUT.  
        - CDN acts as reverse proxy: forwards request to origin, adds security, TLS termination, compression, rate limits.  

-   DNS → CDN Routing
    - Domain DNS points to CDN (not origin).  
    - Methods: A record, AAAA record, CNAME (most common).  
    - CDN decides: serve static, forward dynamic, apply protection.

-   How CDN Detects Dynamic
    - Headers: Cache-Control (no-store/private), Set-Cookie, Authorization.  
    - HTTP Methods: GET → cacheable, POST/PUT/DELETE → not cached.  
    - Rules: Developer-defined (e.g., `/api/*` no cache, `/images/*` cache 30 days).

-   Push vs Pull CDN
    - ✔️ Pull CDN (common): fetches from origin on first request, caches for future.  
        - Best for websites, e-commerce, blogs, news.  
    - ✔️ Push CDN: content uploaded in advance.  
        - Best for large files (videos, software, game assets).  


-   Full Request Flow
    - Static:  
        User → DNS → CDN → Cache Hit → User  
        (Cache miss → CDN fetches from origin → stores → serves).  
    - Dynamic:  
        User → DNS → CDN → Origin → CDN → User  
        (No caching, but optimized delivery).  

-   Why DNS Always Points to CDN
    - Even dynamic requests go via CDN.  
    - CDN applies rules (cookies, auth, POST → no cache).  
    - Acts as smart reverse proxy → forwards to origin.

-   Extra Features
    - Security: DDoS protection, bot filtering, WAF, rate limiting.  
    - Performance: Image optimization, compression, HTTP/2/3, TLS termination, TCP pooling.  
    - Reliability: Failover routing, multi-CDN, global load balancing.

-   CDN Use Cases
    - 🛒 E-commerce: product images cached, carts forwarded.  
    - 🎥 Video streaming: thumbnails cached, segmented streaming (HLS/DASH).  
    - 🎮 Gaming: updates/assets cached, real-time handled separately.  
    - ☁️ SaaS/Web apps: JS bundles cached, API calls proxied.  
    - 📰 News/blogs: pull CDN → cached pages scale to millions.  
    - 📱 Mobile apps: images/config/assets cached globally.

-   One-Line Summary
    A CDN is a distributed network that caches static content at global edge servers and proxies dynamic content to the origin, improving speed, reliability, and scalability.
