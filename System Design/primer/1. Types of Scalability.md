-   Scalability
    Scalability is the ability of a system to handle increasing workload or demand by adding resources without compromising performance.
    -   Vertical Scaling : Increasing the capacity of a single machine (like adding more CPU, RAM, or storage) to improve system performance.
    -   Horizontal Scaling : Adding more machines or servers to a system so it can handle greater loads in parallel.

    -   Pro's and con's
        1.  HS requires load balancer for requests while VS not.
        2.  VS is single point of failure while HS is resilient
        3.  VS will be fast as there will be interprocess communication while HS will be bit slow due to network calls between servers (Remote Procedure Calls)
        4.  Data Consistency is Issue in HS while in VS is not
        5.  VS has a hardware limit to which we can increase while HS can be scaled to a larger extent.
