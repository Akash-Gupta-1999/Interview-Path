-   Intro to SQL 
    SQL stands for Structured Query Language
    SQL is used to communicate with databases
    It allows you to store, retrieve, update, and delete data
    SQL is essential for Data Engineers, Analysts, and Developers

-   What is a DBMS?

    Key Points:
        -   DBMS = Database Management System
        -   Software that helps users create and manage databases

    Handles:
        Data storage
        Data security
        Data retrieval
    
    Examples:
        MySQL
        PostgreSQL
        SQL Server
        Oracle


-   SQL Server (RDBMS)

    Key Points:
        SQL Server is a Relational Database Management System (RDBMS)
        Data is stored in tables (rows and columns)
        Tables can be related using keys
        Uses SQL as the querying language

-   Types of Databases

    Key Points:
    Relational Databases
        Data stored in tables
        Example: PostgreSQL, MySQL
        
    NoSQL Databases
        Schema-less or flexible schema
        Example: MongoDB, Cassandra
    
    Data Warehouses
        Optimized for analytics
        Example: BigQuery, Redshift

-   Database Structure

    Key Points:
        Database contains schemas
        Schema contains tables, views, functions
        Table consists of:
            Rows → records
            Columns → attributes

-   Database Structure (Continued)

    Key Points:
        Each table should have a primary key
        Tables can be linked using foreign keys
        Proper structure improves:
            Performance
            Data integrity

-   How Tables are Stored

    Key Points:
        Data is stored on disk in pages/blocks
        Rows are written sequentially
        Indexes help speed up data retrieval
        Poor design leads to slow queries

-   Types of SQL Commands

    Key Points:
        DDL (Data Definition Language): CREATE, ALTER, DROP
        DML (Data Manipulation Language): INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE
        DQL (Data Query Language): SELECT
        DCL (Data Control Language): GRANT, REVOKE

-   Why Learn SQL?

    SQL is industry standard
    Required for:
        Data Engineering
        Data Analytics
        Backend Development
    Works across almost all databases
    Easy to learn, very powerful
